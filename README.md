## Overview
This Hospital Management System is designed to streamline the management of hospital operations. It includes functionalities to handle patient and doctor records, schedule appointments, manage room assignments, calculate bills, and much more.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

- **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-management-system.git
   
## Triggers
- **billing_and_update_charges**: This trigger is used to insert billing information and update charges automatically whenever a new appointment is scheduled.

- **upd_room**: This trigger is executed before inserting a new record into the Room table. It automatically sets the room status to 'Empty' if the Patient_id is NULL, indicating the room is unoccupied. If a Patient_id is provided, the status is set to 'Full', indicating the room is occupied.



## Usage
Once the database is set up, you can interact with it using SQL queries or integrate it with a web application. Below are some key SQL queries:

- **Insert a new patient:**
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Patient (Patient_id, First_name, Last_name, Nationality, Gender, Address, DOB, Phone, Email)
  VALUES ('101', 'John', 'Doe', 'USA', 'Male', '123 Street', '1990-01-01', '1234567890', 'john@example.com');
- **Schedule an appointment:**
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Appointment (Patient_id, Doctor_id, APP_date, APP_time)
  VALUES ('101', '203', '2024-08-15', '10:00:00');
